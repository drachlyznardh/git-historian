Vertical unroll
===============

As it is loaded, the graph grows from top to bottom, from recent to past
commits, as Git gives it; each commit knows its parent(s). With the first walk
of the graph as it is, each commit gets to know its children.

Starting from the first head, the unrolling orders commits with two rule:

 - a commit appears only after all its children;
 - a commit appears strictly before any of its parents;

Horizontal unroll
=================

Conjecture: in each line, only “open branches” take columns. If I keep a list of
supposely straight vertical lines connecting a branch's head to its foot, I may
be able to push whole columns around as needed.

Done.

Layout
======

Whenever branch do not cross-merge, things work well. Colors are also working
properly.

Here's an idea: printing can be performed by walking the graph. Now that each
node knows its direct family, I can shield the execution of the print method
with two criteria:

 - no father gets printed before its child; each node prints itself before
   invoking its parents;

 - no child gets printed after its parent; each node invokes its children before
   printing itself;

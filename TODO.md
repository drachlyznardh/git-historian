# TODO

- *Headhunter*: there must be a --all option to get all the heads, which then
  can be ordered as specified; maybe it should a whole new class, since
  Historian is getting fatâ€¦
- *Virtual nodes*, which could act as placeholders; plus, it could be somehow
  useful to have an artificial global head node and a global sink; not sure how
  to deal with multiple disconnected histories (should I even bother?);
- *Layers*: brothers could live inside the same layer, and so could cousins; it
  may be easier to align them by layer than by actual vertical order;

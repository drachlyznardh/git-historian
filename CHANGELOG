Release 0.1.1-1 – 2017/12/17
============================

Adding support for option -FHVM to modify layout. Mostly working, even if some
combinations may show artifacts or broken history

Release 0.1.0-1 – 2017/12/10
============================

Showing all heads prefix-matching arguments, stopping when not inside a
repository, properly handling unknown options.

Release 0.1.0-0 – 2014/04/26
============================

Huge refactoring of the whole project. More configuration, more options, less
debugging mess, better performance.

Release 0.0-j – 2014/04/25
==========================

Renaming the project githistorian with no dash, so that in can be imported and
loaded as a Python module. Structural fixes.

Release 0.0-i – 2015/04/24
=========================

Arguments can match refnames exactly (with -x, --exact, --exact-match) or by
prefix (default or with --prefix, --prefix-match).

Release 0.0-k – 2015/04/24
=========================

Since history size could be cut to N, some merge nodes would lose (some of)
their children; the disappearence of the second last child made the father node
look like a normal point in the chain, instead of a proper merge.

Now, missing nodes that could originate such situations have placeholders with no
content message (they appear as […] in the graph). This unfortunately allows the
history graph to grow beyhond the specified N; I don't this would be a huge
problem, but we'll see.

Release 0.0-h – 2015/04/20
=========================

Once again, I can test the usage for two minutes or half an hour, but the only
problem will show up only after I release the udpate. Fixing release 0.0-g. I'll
probably run out of characters soon enough…

Release 0.0-g – 2015/04/20
=========================

Fixed weird bug when two heads share the same commit.

Release 0.0-f – 2015/02/27
=========================

Fixed support for limited history size. I'm dumb. I'm so dumb.

Release 0.0-e – 2015/02/26
=========================

Added support for limited history size with -nN

Release 0.0-d – 2014/11/01
=========================

Codebase was almost completely rewritten again

Release 0.0-b – 2014/10/17
=========================

Codebase was almost completely rewritten

Release 0.0-a – 2014/10/03
=========================
